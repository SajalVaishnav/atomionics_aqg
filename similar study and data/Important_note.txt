******Note******

The ocean loading correction in some of the AQG#B01 data files shows a sign error due to a software issue at the time.
The corrected gravity value given in the data is calculated from:
g_corrected = g_raw - sum(corrections)

The ocean loading correction needs hence to be added than to be subtracted. Practically speaking, adding 2 x delta_g_ocean_loading..nm.s.2. to "corrected.vertical.gravity..nm.s.2." compensates for this error.
